## Slide 2: Overview
The haze phenomenon has persistently return to Malaysia and Singapore on an annual basis over the past 3 decades. 

This simple application was created to illustrate and analyse the Air Pollution Index (API) readings collected from 2013 to 2015 at the town Banting (near capital Kuala Lumpur) in Malaysia to examine the haze situation.
